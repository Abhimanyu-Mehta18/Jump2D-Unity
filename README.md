# 🎮 Simple 2D Jump Game (Unity Project)

This is a **simple 2D level-based jump game** developed using **Unity**, when I was in **9th grade**. It's a straightforward arcade-style game featuring a ball that jumps over obstacles to progress through levels.

## 🕹️ Game Overview

- 👾 **2D gameplay** with intuitive controls
- 🏐 The **player controls a ball** that jumps when the on-screen jump button is pressed
- ⬜ Avoid **square-shaped obstacles** by jumping over them
- 📈 The game consists of **three levels**:
  - Completing a level unlocks the next one
  - The game ends after successfully completing all three levels
- 💀 If the player hits an obstacle, the current level **restarts**

## 📱 Android APK

You can try the game directly on your Android device without using Unity.

### ▶️ To Run the Game:

1. Go to the `Builds/` folder in this repository.
2. Download the file: `jump_game.apk`
3. Transfer it to your Android device and install it.
   - You may need to allow "Install from Unknown Sources" in your phone settings.

⚠️ **Note**:  
The APK file is **not tracked for future commits** due to size and repository hygiene. If you are cloning or initializing this repo for development, you may not see the APK. In that case, you can either:

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- The **`Library/` and `Temp/` folders are not included** in the GitHub repository because of size restrictions.
  - After cloning the repo, Unity will **automatically regenerate these folders** when the project is opened.
  - This may take a few minutes depending on your system.
