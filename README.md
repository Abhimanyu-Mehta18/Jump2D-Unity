# 🎮 Simple 2D Jump Game (Unity Project)

This is a **simple 2D level-based jump game** developed using **Unity**, when I was in **9th grade**. It's a straightforward arcade-style game featuring a ball that jumps over obstacles to progress through levels.

## 🕹️ Game Overview

- 👾 **2D gameplay** with intuitive controls
- 🏐 The **player controls a ball** that jumps when the on-screen jump button is pressed
- ⬜ Avoid **square-shaped obstacles** by jumping over them
- 📈 The game consists of **three levels**:
  - Completing a level unlocks the next one
  - The game ends after successfully completing all three levels
- 💀 If the player hits an obstacle, the current level **restarts**

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This project was created with an **older version of Unity** (likely Unity 2020 or 2021).
  - It **might not work perfectly with newer versions** of Unity due to compatibility issues.
- The **`Library/` and `Temp/` folders are not included** in the GitHub repository because of size restrictions.
  - After cloning the repo, Unity will **automatically regenerate these folders** when the project is opened.
  - This may take a few minutes depending on your system.

## 🧩 How to Run the Game

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-2d-jump-game.git
